Peer Review: Jacob Shulman 

Your website is really easy to navigate and has a clear direction. It seems to satisfy all requirements and has a very well thought out design. The look of the site is actually really good. Far better than what I expected and much better than mine. It may even be beyond what was asked of you. For my website, I chose to do a wiki of sorts on a video game series. I spent most of my time doing research and writing on the topic of these articles instead of focusing on the creativity of my site, which I can see that you focused on. Each page of your site has a focused topic that clearly displays the information. I also like that your form fields have a prerequisite to submit which was the inclusion of the @ symbol. The only thing that I can think of that would even be a complaint is that on the index page, the animation that plays leaves a blinking type marker, but that is just a nitpick. All in all, I really liked your site.
