        <h1>Report</h1>
        <p>1.   My website serves JMU Club Baseball.</p>
        <p>2.   All images were designed by members of the Club Baseball team.</p>
        <p>3.   My site contains 5 pages, index.html is loaded by default.</p>
        <p>4.   My site includes a header.</p>
        <p>5.   My site includes navigation links.</p>
        <p>6.   My site uses media queries to differentiate between small and large screens.</p>
        <p>7.   Repeated styles are in a shared spreadsheet, shared_style.css, while non-shared styles are in their own pages.</p>
        <p>8.   All images define their alt attributes.</p>
        <p>9.   Each page declares its favicon, the Duke Dog head.</p>
        <p>10.  Images are placed in a directory named 'images', CSS is placed in a directory named 'css'.</p>
        <p>11.  I have no idea how to use any of those frameworks yet, therefore my site does not incorporate any of them.</p>
        <p>12.  Each page in my project validates without warnings using Nu Validator.</p>
        <p>13.  To my knowledge, all content is consistently aligned. I favored left-alignment.</p>
        <p>14.  Also to my knowledge, all content is consistently spaced. Nothing bleeds against the edge of its containing box.</p>
        <p>15.  My site uses a sans-serif font for my headings and a serif font for paragraph content.</p>
        <p>16.  Although it doesn't do anything, my site contains a form.</p>
        <p>17.  My site includes multiple links to external sites.</p>
        <p>18.  I use consistent formatting in my source code, I favored kebab-case over camelCase.</p>
        <p>19.  My site contains an animation, a typewritter effect on the Home page.</p>
        <p>20.  My site is stored in a Git repository and shared with the user 'hcientist' (I needed help in class with that).</p>
        <p>21.  The names of all files in this project are entirely lowercase and only contain alphanumeric characters.</p>
        <p>22.  Both https://project1.jshulman.me and http://project1.jshulman.me resolve to the same site, the latter resolving to the former.</p>
        <p>23.  I used Let's Encrypt to obtain a certificate.</p>
        <p>24.  Users accessing my site on port 80 are automatically redirected to port 443.</p>
        <p>25.  My git repository shows a steady flow of commits, as I have committed multiple times during each work session.</p>
        <p>26.  You are reading this report at https://project1.jshulman.me/report.html</p>
